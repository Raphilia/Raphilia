Just a person who typically play PC games during my free time and do a little bit of writing when I feel like it. I studied Computer Science for 2 years, recent projects include a [Discord bot](https://github.com/Raphilia/watame) and [food ordering website](https://github.com/Raphilia/food-creation).
