### Just a person who's caught in the flow of the world.

I typically play PC games during my free time and do a little bit of writing when I feel like it. I studied Computer Science for 2 years, recent projects includes a [Discord bot](https://github.com/Raphilia/watame) and [food ordering website](https://github.com/Raphilia/food-creation).

Overall just a shut-in NEET who happen to love anime a bit too much âœ¨

*PS: I also own [sleepingknights.moe](https://sleepingknights.moe)*
